            There are already many articles describing Product Hunt launches. So
            we decided to write one more:)

          <p>One liners and message for groups or social.</p>
          <p>
            I like to have 2-4 versions of it, so I can select best for
            different places.

            2. Warm up your audience
          </h3>
          <p>
            We took part into <strong>Product Hunt discussion</strong>, wrote a
            bit on <strong>Twitter</strong>,{" "}
            <strong>Linkedin and Reddit</strong> about the launch.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some companies also send the email in advance with your coming soon
            page for people to follow, but we did not.
          </p>
          {/* 3. Create list of your supporters */}
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">
            3. Create list of your supporters
          </h3>
          <p>
            Our list was quite small like 20-30 people, and I kept in mind all
            my friends in twitter and linkedin who could be interested in the
            launch.
          </p>
          <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-gray-500 pl-4 my-4">

            Which means only meaningful connections will be helpful, not random
            reach outs and asking for the vote:)

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">
            4. Create the list of places where to post
          </h3>
          <p>
            This is important one, as everyone has the groups they want to reach
            people in. <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>We used 3 types of groups:</strong>
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              - PH support groups (Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Telegram, Reddit)
              <br />
              The best output was in WhatsApp and Telegram
            </li>
            <li>- Building in public/indihacker places</li>
            <li>- Places for open source</li>
          </ol>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">
            5. Prepare visuals: video, images, gif
          </h3>
          <p>
            🤓 Of course, you need them for the PH page.
            <br />
            But I found it useful to send them also in the groups, that people
            see small video or GIF straight and decide if it is interesting to
            click.

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">
            6. Reach 10-20 people in advance for feedback
          </h3>
          <p>
            One more thing I kind of doing before every launch is finding test
            users, so send a couple of people a link to the product, mentioning
            you plan to launch.
          </p>
          <p>
            Works especially well for new products which don&apos;t have any
            feedback.
          </p>
          <p>
            We started preparing <strong>1 week</strong> before launch.
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 pt-6">
            During the launch day
          </h2>
          <p>
            Launch day is mostly about <strong>sharing</strong> that you launch
            on social and then continuously <strong>engaging</strong>.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">1. Launch your tweet</h3>

          <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-gray-500 pl-4 my-4">
            <p>20% of efforts bring 80% of result. Pareto also works here</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            I think the most important is a tweet. I got previous
            recommendations about it from{" "}
            <a href="https://twitter.com/heyeaslo">Easlo</a>. This tip I still
            follow. One core tweet which you share with people.

            width="500"
            height="300"
          />
          <p>
            Even if you don&apos;t have a community and a big following on
            Twitter, I would aim to make the tweet interesting and focus on it.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">
            2. Post on other social platforms: LinkedIn, Devto
          </h3>
          <p>
            Only recommend this if you have a following or activity on LinkedIn.
            Maybe if you never post there, it will not work.

            3. Engage in PH comments
          </h3>
          <p>
            The priority is to engage in comments after you shared about the
            launch. You will sometimes feel like a bot in these comments, but I
            feel like everyone deserves a response who wrote to you on PH :)
          </p>

          />
          <p>
            I don&apos;t know how currently PH count it, I think they are
            looking only at upvotes but I still find that important.

            Your and your company profiles are styled and linked to the PH

          <p>If your product is open source, where to look for support?</p>
          <p>
            Use the Open Source channels, I am sure if you are building
            something in Open Source and planning to launch, you know other
            popular projects, communities in the space, and people.
          </p>
          <p>But let&apos;s say not, where could you start?</p>
          <p>There are some Open Source places where you can get support.</p>

            Q&A Have some questions? ❓

          <p>
            Some questions I kind of ask myself and maybe will be interesting to
            anyone who is reading this:
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">
            Can you reengineer a successful launch?
          </h3>
          <p>
            No, I think no. It is similar to re-engineering a viral post. There
            is always a combination of different factors.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">
            Can someone guarantee you success?
          </h3>
          <p>
            There are people selling votes, or the first place. I received
            offers like that. My personal recommendation is not to engage, for 5
            reasons:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>It can be easily tracked</li>
            <li>PH can &quot;punish&quot; you for that</li>
            <li>You will damage your company brand if people find out</li>
            <li>You will not see your real supporters and community around</li>
            <li>Fewer people will hear about your brand</li>
          </ol>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">
            Is building in public helping me launch?
          </h3>
          <p>
            I think this is the main helper. Building in public, writing about
            your project no matter if it&apos;s open-source or not is a
            long-term game.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Can my launch fail?</h3>
          <p>
            To me, no. I will give you an example. I missed the launch of
            another product I built. I scheduled it and forgot, just was doing
            something else, I realized it in one week, one weeeeek!
            <br />
            So yes, some may say it was a failure, but no, I can always relaunch
            it, and this one was just a PURE Product Hunt LAUNCH, like in the
            good old days :))
